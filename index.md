Ever wonder who spends the most on food delivery apps? Through a deep dive into iFood's customer data (Brazil's dominant delivery platform), I discovered that child-free customers, particularly wine enthusiasts, are driving the company's revenue. Using Excel to analyze 2,205 customer records, I uncovered surprising patterns: child-free customers spend 103% more annually than those with children, with wine purchases leading at $306 per customer. This analysis challenges common assumptions about family spending habits and reveals key insights about consumer behavior in the growing food delivery market.
