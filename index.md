Ever wonder who spends the most on food delivery apps? Through a deep dive into iFood's customer data (Brazil's dominant delivery platform), I discovered that child-free customers, particularly wine enthusiasts, are driving the company's revenue. Using Excel to analyze 2,205 customer records, I uncovered surprising patterns: child-free customers spend 103% more annually than those with children, with wine purchases leading at $306 per customer. This analysis challenges common assumptions about family spending habits and reveals key insights about consumer behavior in the growing food delivery market.

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:
What schools are struggling the most?
How does class size affect college admission?
What are the top math schools in the state?

#### [Massachusetts Education Correction](/sample_project.md)
üìä I realized my last analysis on the Massachusetts' Education System missed the mark - by a long shot.
üßê In the spirit of transparency and continuous learning, I'm sharing my correction and three valuable lessons that transformed my approach to data analysis.
