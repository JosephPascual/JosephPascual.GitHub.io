# Learning From My Data Analysis Mistakes: A Reflection on Responsibility

"With great power comes great responsibility."

This famous Spider-Man quote has been echoing in my mind lately, particularly because I need to address a mistake in my latest data analysis project. Actually, three mistakes – each offering valuable lessons about our responsibilities as data analysts.

## The Power of Data Analysis

As data analysts, we wield significant influence through our ability to transform raw data into insights that drive real-world decisions. Leaders trust us to present truth through data, not confirmation of our own biases. This trust makes it especially important to acknowledge when we fall short.

## What Prompted This Reflection

Recently, while listening to Julia Galef's audiobook, "Scout Mindset," I experienced that uncomfortable feeling that signals something isn't quite right with how I approached my last data project. The book discusses approaching our beliefs like a scout rather than a soldier – exploring to discover truth rather than defending existing positions. This framework helped me recognize several critical errors in my analysis.

## The Three Critical Mistakes

### 1. The Seduction of Shock Value

Galef introduced the concept of "motivated reasoning", our tendency to process information in ways that support our preferred conclusions rather than truth. I fell into this trap by desiring a "wow factor" that would make my analysis more impactful. This desire to impress led me to accept a suspicious data point (a 0% graduation rate) without proper scrutiny.

### 2. The Shallow Analysis Trap

I failed to apply "Chesterton's Fence" principle, the idea that before criticizing an established system, we must first understand why it exists. Instead of investigating why a school showed a 0% graduation rate, I rushed to make bold recommendations about avoiding certain schools and calling for systemic changes. A more diligent approach would have been to recognize this outlier as a red flag warranting deeper investigation.

### 3. The Fundamental Data Misunderstanding

Lastly, when I presented my data about 4th grade math levels, I claimed this data was about individual schools, but I've realized that this data is about school districts. Galef emphasizes the importance of "updating incrementally", being willing to revise our understanding when we discover mistakes, rather than clinging to our initial interpretations. Instead of defending my original misinterpretation, I need to update my understanding, and more importantly, correct the record.

## The Path to Correction

### Understanding the Full Context

What initially appeared as a concerning statistic – a 0% graduation rate – revealed something far different upon deeper investigation. Curtis Tufts isn't failing its students; it's serving a specialized population with unique needs. With 100% of its student body classified as Students With Disabilities, the school likely focuses on crucial developmental outcomes and life skills that traditional graduation metrics don't capture.

This realization underscores why context is essential in data analysis. A single metric in isolation can be deeply misleading, especially when dealing with specialized educational institutions.

### Concrete Steps for Correction

* Data Visualization Update
  * Revising my 4th grade math performance visualization to correctly label it as district-level data
  * The updated version will include previously missing values to ensure completeness

* Public Correction
  * Publishing this reflection alongside the corrected analysis
  * The original post will be updated with a prominent correction notice and link to this reflection
  * Reaching out to anyone who shared or acted on the original analysis

* Setting the Record Straight about Curtis Tufts
  * Acknowledging that traditional graduation rates aren't an appropriate metric for evaluating specialized schools
  * Highlighting the importance of understanding institutional context before making recommendations
  * Retracting previous recommendations about school choice decisions

## Lessons for the Future

This experience has reinforced several crucial principles for responsible data analysis:

* Question the Outliers: Extreme values should trigger deeper investigation, not immediate conclusions
* Understand the Context: Educational data, especially, requires understanding the unique circumstances of each institution
* Verify Data Definitions: Always double-check whether data represents schools, districts, or other organizational levels
* Challenge Your Assumptions: When findings seem shocking, that's precisely when we need to dig deeper

## Conclusion

Data analysis carries real responsibility – our work affects perceptions of actual institutions and communities. To the Curtis Tufts school community: I sincerely apologize for misrepresenting your specialized mission through my incomplete analysis. Your dedication to supporting students with disabilities deserves recognition, not mischaracterization. This experience has taught me the crucial importance of understanding context and approaching analysis with greater diligence. Moving forward, I commit to remembering that behind every number is a story that deserves to be told accurately and completely.
